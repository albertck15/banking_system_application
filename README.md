# Banking System Application

This project imitates a banking account handler application.
I started this app because I think systems like this are in our every day, and even if it is a simple system, it is very important to make them 
maintainable and easy to use.
As crypto will rise as a payment (or just the idea itself of going to a cashless world), it will be more and more important to have stable, clean, and secure
systems. 

## Setting up the application

I have included the script files to set up the database. 
Start with executing the *'albert_banking_system_user.sql'* file, then execute the 
*'albert_banking_system_balance.sql'*. 

__*I'll add a transaction script later*__

## What this application can do?

Currently, you can register an account or log in to an already registered one, there are some features built-in
like the application asks if you would like to register if you try to log in to an account that does not exist.
I'll add more things like getting balance, making "withdraws", getting balance, and making a transaction.
